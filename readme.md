The overall purpose of this project is to process a given image to assess vegetation health using the SAVI method, apply preprocessing for better visualisation, and save the resulting image with enhanced colors for easier interpretation of vegetation data. The histogram plot helps understand the distribution of SAVI values in the image, making this code useful in environmental studies or agriculture monitoring.
